It's important to note that this disclosure does not include any sensitive user data, authentication secrets, or proprietary game information.

## Development Environment Note

Currently, this project does not use Docker for development due to hardware limitations. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to contributors who prefer containerized environments.

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

While we strive to make this project as open as possible, we remind all viewers and potential contributors to respect intellectual property rights. The database structure is designed specifically for our community application and should not be used in any way that violates the terms of service of Nikke: Goddess of Victory or infringes upon the rights of Shift Up Corporation or any other entities.
